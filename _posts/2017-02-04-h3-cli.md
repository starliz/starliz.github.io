#### Linux Basics (dat8tf063-29)

#### HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences.

### Nice CLI tutorials:

[LearnPythonTheHardWay/CLI](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/)

It recommends to use 'pushd'/'popd', but usually having couple of tabs in my terminal is enough for me,
but educated people recommend to use terminal multiplexors like -  `tmux`


### My own BASH Reference List:

Plug in device and see where it's mounted:
* `dmesg | grep mounted | tail -n 10`

Archives:
* `tar -czvf ./name_new_file.tar.gz ./app/dir_where`
* `tar -cjvf /home/nemo/journal.tar.bz2 -C /var/log/ journal`
* `tar -pxvf /path/image` - extract preserving permissions
* ` -j` - bzip2
* ` -z` - gzip
* ` -C` - change to directory

Permissions:
* `chmod 0644  /path/to/filename.ext`
* r 4, w 2, x 1
* rx = 5, rw = 6, rwx = 7
* `chmod u+w /path/to/filename.ext`
