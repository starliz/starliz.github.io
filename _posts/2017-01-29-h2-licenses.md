### Course assignment 2
### Linux Basics (dat8tf063-29)
### HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences.
 
The 2nd class was about licenses and the task is to list all apps, which student uses (assuming itâ€™s about Windows ;)) and to find an open source match. I decided to check licenses for my daily apps.
