### Course assignment 2

#### Linux Basics (dat8tf063-29)

##### HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences.
 
The 2nd class was about licenses and the task is to list all apps, which student uses (assuming it’s about Windows ;)) and to find an open source match. I decided to check licenses for my daily apps.

List of SW I use and corresponding licenses (with hyperlinks):

* Google Chrome browser - Freeware under Google Chrome Terms of Service (proprietary). Chromium browser is its open-source alternative.
* Mozilla Firefox browser - Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL)
* Libre Office (Writer, Calc, Impress) - Mozilla Public License v2.0
* Okular (PDF viewer) - GNU General Public License Version 2
* Telegram Web - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3
* Dolphin (file manager) - GNU General Public License Version 2
* mc (file manager) - GNU General Public License
* Gwenview (image viewer) - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2
* Gimp (GNU Image Manipulation Program) - GNU General Public License
* VLC (video player) - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2
* GNU Emacs - GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3


Some examples of other licenses I encountered:
