#### Course assignment 2: SW Licenses

#### Linux Basics (dat8tf063-29)

#### HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences.
 
The 2nd class was about licenses and the task was to list all apps, which student uses (assuming it’s about Windows ;)) and to find an open source alternative. Since I run Fedora on my laptop, I decided to check licenses for my daily apps.

As additional exercise I made this page using tutorial for GitHub Pages (see reference in the bottom of the page). It doesn't look very well now, but I plan to update it later.

##### List of SW I use and corresponding licenses (with hyperlinks):
