#### Linux Basics (dat8tf063-29)

#### HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences.
 
#### Updated on 13.03.2017

### The task:

Full task description can be found [here](http://terokarvinen.com/2017/agenda-for-linux-basics-dat8tf063-29-spring-2017#comment-22122).

The 2nd class was about licenses and the task was to list all apps, which student uses (assuming it’s about Windows ;)) and to find an open source alternative. 
Since I run Fedora on my laptop, I decided to check licenses for my daily apps.

As additional exercise I made this page using [tutorial for GitHub Pagess](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). It doesn't look very well now, but I plan to update it later, find a [prettier CSS](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp).

### Used articles:

[Guide how to build a blog using Github pages](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

[How to use Jekyll locally](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/) to verify web pages before pushing to master:
  * basically just:
    * `jekyll build` - to build web site pages
    * `jekyll serve --detach` - run server (detached from the current terminal) to preview generated site
    * access via browser: <http://localhost:4000/>
