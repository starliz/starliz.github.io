### Using journalctl:

Some interesting directories to look for logs:

````
[liz@localhost log]$ pwd
/var/log
[liz@localhost log]$ ls -al
drwxr-xr-x.  2 lp       sys                 4096 Jan 11 18:25 cups
drwxr-sr-x+  3 root     systemd-journal     4096 Jan 29 15:31 journal
````

`journald` - is a daemon which logs data about system and running services.

`journalctl` - is a command to interact with journal, without options it gives entire journal content which can be scrolled with arrows.

Journal may be persistent over reboot or not.

`journal -b` - shows data since last boot up.

`journalctl -f` - follows current log messages, it allows to see immediately data for actions you do.


### Example 1, beginning of journal:

````
[liz@localhost log]$ journalctl -b
-- Logs begin at Wed 2017-02-08 18:03:24 EET, end at Sat 2017-02-11 20:14:00 EET. --
Feb 08 18:03:24 localhost.localdomain systemd-journald[197]: Runtime journal (/run/log/journal/) is 8.0M, max 384.1M, 376.1M free.
````

It has many fields with metadata. In shown example, first goes info message "Logs begin...", on next line: date and time.
Option `verbose` gives some hints about which field is what:

```
liz@localhost starliz.github.io]$ journalctl -o verbose
...
SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER - systemd-journald,
JOURNAL_NAME=Runtime journal
JOURNAL_PATH=/run/log/journal/
CURRENT_USE_PRETTY=8.0M
MAX_USE_PRETTY=384.1M
AVAILABLE_PRETTY=376.1M
...
```

So this log entry tells from which service is the message, what is the name of journal, what is the path to it,
how much disc space does it take, what is maximum and how much is available.

### Example 2, error message:
`journalctl -p n` - option -p allows to select log entries by level of priority, 
i.e.  "emerg" (0), "alert" (1), "crit" (2), "err" (3), "warning" (4), "notice" (5), "info" (6), "debug" (7).
           
````
[liz@localhost log]$ journalctl -p 1
-- No entries --
````
There is no priority 1 records. But for level 3 I got quite enough:

````
[liz@localhost log]$ journalctl -p 3

Also messages can be filtered by service or daemon:

````
[liz@localhost log]$ journalctl -p 3 | grep cupsd

[liz@localhost log]$ 
````
Again, each record starts with general information about date, time, host name, service name - cupsd is a printing scheduler.
My guess is that "Client" means some connection, a kind of client-server interaction, which failed here.

Next I tried googling, mainly I found errors telling about Jobs problems - I had no troubles with printing itself (printed some real paper pages and also to PDF file).
Also found that IPP is an Internet protocol for communication between computers and printers (or print server).

Tried read config file: 

````
[liz@localhost log]$ sudo less /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
````

didn't find anything helpful and then browsed through man pages

````
[liz@localhost log]$ man cupsd-logs
````

Examples in "man" file give some insight, but format doesn't match exactly my case.

My approach is filtering logs and then just attempting to see if some words will catch my attention, search for some meaningful messages.
Since I'm not administrator or programmer I don't know details about the service and it's logging specific format.
